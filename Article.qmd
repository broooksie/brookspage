**Climate Catastrophe is Already Underway**

The nightmares that scientists warned about in years past are already here. This summer, the world saw an unprecedented amount of community- (and sometimes country-) shattering disasters. Often, the news cycle in the Global North ignores many of the most disastrous showcases of the path our world is heading down.

One of the major ignorances of this summer was the lack of coverage on the floods that wracked Pakistan. The country has been flooding since this June, and as of now, a total of 1,717 people have died from the floods, and over 35 million have been displaced. The Sindh province -- where much of the flooding took place -- received 784% more rainfall than the usual average. The country, in a matter of months, was underwater. A country that is responsible for one percent of global carbon emissions felt the brunt of the consequences for the Global North's 92%. As the severity of the crisis deepens, the Global South will be first to experience the brunt, and even when extreme crises reach the Global North, it's fair to say they will be slow to act.

Another overlooked crisis that happened this summer were extreme droughts in northern Mexico that lasted the entirety of the summer, leaving millions to have to forgo the most basic of human necessities. The city of Monterrey, home of over 5 million people, was hit the hardest. A journalist for the New York Times stated that they could not find drinking water at a number of stores throughout the city -- and that the people had to rely on government deliveries of water or pay at least \$60 for a tank of drinking water. Crises such as these create a cruel divide in class lines. Those that can afford expensive shipments of water get off easy, while the lower classes have to fend for themselves to survive. Throughout the drought, Coca-Cola and Heinekin continued to extract billions of gallons of water from private wells in the region. So much so that activists popularized the phrase "No es sequÃ­a, es saqueo" ("It's not drought, it's plunder"). All changes that the Global North has been trying to make are far too little too late. The World Bank and the IMF continue to struggle to follow even the Paris Agreement, an agreement that was criticized by the people that helped make it as being not nearly radical enough. The Global North as a whole is dedicated on its path towards incremental, inconsequential change. The only change that will reverse the course is a total restructuring of our economic system. We need to keep on fighting, and advocate for only the most radical of changes.
